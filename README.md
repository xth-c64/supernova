my first try of a simple C64 game

Looks like i'm no gfx superhero, if you could do it better, contact me.

Got 8 Sprites to work, added Score and Shots Counter. 

Code by myself except Title Picture viewer based on TMR's code (lemon64) and Irq Sid Music Player based on Richard's code.

Todo:
improve the graphics, add Levels, add Game Over Screen and maybe much more

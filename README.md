my first try of a simple C64 game

Looks like i'm no gfx superhero, if you could do it better, contact me.

Got 8 Sprites to work, made a charset, done the titlepic, added Score and Shots Counter. 

Code by myself except Title Picture viewer based on TMR's code (lemon64) and Irq Sid Music Player based on Richard's code.

Latest Updates:
- added a better Titlepic (converted)


Todo:
improve the graphics, add Levels, add Game Over Screen and maybe much more
